# Grow-A-Garden-Automation

An automation program for the game Grow A Garden on Roblox.
- Buying shops when they reset(seeds, gear, (maybe pets and event shops)), and allowing people the functionality to buy specific items only
- Automatic calibration through using relative coordinates, allowing it to work on different screen sizes
- Allowing the user to stop and start the program whenever they want with the push of a button

**WARNING:** Currently, the program is only guaranteed to work at a certain camera angle. Face away from the garden, looking a bit towards the seed shop. Will work on having it function for any camera angle.
